    * phashes produced via fields::new() will now not warn when used for
      forward compatiblity purposes
    - Reformatting the docs to make them a bit more readable
    - Making it clear that fields::new() is usable with or without

    * Fixing inheritence from classes which have only private fields
    * Fixing inheritence when an intermediate class has no fields.
